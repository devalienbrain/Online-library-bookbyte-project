The library management software named BookByte developed using React with CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality and JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication and security.

Here are the key features about the software:

- [User Authentication:] Implement JWT-based user authentication to ensure secure access to the software and restrict certain functionalities to authorized users.

- [User Roles and Permissions:] Define different user roles (e.g., librarians, administrators, patrons) with specific permissions to control what actions they can perform within the system.

- [Book Catalog Management:] Add new books to the catalog with details like title, author, genre, and cover image. Edit existing book information. Delete books from the catalog.

- [Check-out and Check-in:] Allow patrons to borrow books by checking them out. Track due dates. Enable patrons to return books, updating their status in the system.

- [User-friendly and Responsive web interface:] Develop a user-friendly and responsive web interface using React to ensure a seamless experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
