            BookByte represents a critical pivot in the Library Technology
            landscape. Together libraries and vendors have created an
            environment for collaboration that allows independence and community
            ownership of the capabilities and roadmap for technology that powers
            the library, and the process for managing it. While the technology
            and architecture are to be admired, perhaps the greatest strength of
            BookByte is the community that surrounds it. Open, collaborative,
            modern, sophisticated â€¦ all community owned and directed. Welcome to
            BookByte!
